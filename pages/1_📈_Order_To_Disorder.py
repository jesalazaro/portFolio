    "One of the most important features of the macroscopic systems is the tendency to disorder. An example  of this trend can be seen with the addition of water ink; assuming we have an ink with the same density as water, we add it to the latter carefully, after some time we know that the ink and water mixed; if we have recorded this and we reproduce it backwards we will see that the movement random of the ink molecules is going to return towards the surface of the water, our intuitive thinking tells us How nature works and we will know that something is wrong. From our experience we can say that the trend natural movement of microscopic systems towards disorder defines the direction of time, the water-ink mixture can from being described as a microscopic state. If the process continues without interruption, we will notice that the mixture has become completely homogeneous, when that state arrives,we will be talking about a state of balance"
